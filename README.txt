The file, "data-cut-by-label.py", is a function that takes as input the directory's location of a CSV file, the CSV file name, the length (in rows)of the header, the column number that contains the labels by which the data should be cut, and the column number of an additional data point that will be added to the function's outputs' names. 

After running the function with the proper inputs and the CSV file of data that needs to be "cut", the function should save independent CSV files with the same headers as the original file. The files will be cut and saved by the user-designated labels as briefly explained in the section above.
